# Felicia Wootton - Portfolio #

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I created this website to showcase my projects and programming skills.  Currently, there are no projects.  However, this website will be updated regularly, as new projects are completed.  Inside, you will find my contact information, as well as learn more about me.  

This portfolio is my first code project completed from scratch. I focused on using semantic html to allow accessibility. I added comments to make my code understandable for others.  I used a CSS reset file to make sure my website is consistent across all browsers.  I utilized flexbox and media queries to obtain a responsive design that will fit any screen size.  I added hover effects to the navigation and project links to make the design more interesting.  I learned many useful techniques over the first two weeks of bootcamp.  I hope to update my portfolio even more, as more skills are learned.  

Thank you for visiting!
